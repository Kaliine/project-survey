# Survey form with React
The goal for this project was to practicing React state and controlled forms by making a survey. A survey form of some sort with radio buttons, a select dropdown and a summary.

## What I learnt
- What the purpose of state in React is.
- How to use the useState hook in React.
- How to connect HTML form inputs to state.
- How to use form fields with React

I also continued practicing how to structure React components and write JSX. I very much enjoy working in React - I find it user friendly, I have a better work flow using it and I'm eager to learn more about this framework.
A big part of this project was the styling. Styling forms are always a fun challenge - the radiobuttons and rangeslider was a bit tricky. I'm glad I've now added more experience with that, having completed this project.
