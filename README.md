# Survey form with React
The goal for this project was to build a survey form with React. A survey form of some sort, that consists of at least 3 questions and a summary.

## What I learnt
During this project I learnt about React state and controlled forms. 
I also continued practicing how to structure React components and write JSX.
A big part of this project was the styling. Styling forms are always a fun challenge - the radiobuttons and rangeslider was a bit tricky.
